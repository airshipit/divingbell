1. Put shell error handling into common area (helm-toolkit)
2. Perform revert operations in scripts before applying new settings
3. Refactor .sh into .py
4. Refactor each daemonset to follow the same general systemd pattern; have one
script that can do all of them to reduce code burden.
5. yaml validation: check for duplicate items, unused leaves, etc.
